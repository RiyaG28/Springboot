# Dependency Injection

Write example of user having order= new order()

1. Tightly coupled issue-
2. VIolation of D in SOLID- If order becomes interface and get child classes, then we have to change the code to new OrderChildCLAss();
this principal says do not  depend on concrete class rather depend on abstarction

## What is dependency Injection?

- Using dependency injection, we can make our class independent of dependencies
- remove the dependency from concrete implementation and inject the dependencies from external source

@Autowired, first look for required bean. If found, inject it.


### Different ways of Injection and which one is better?

- Field Injection
- Setter
- Contructor

### Field Injection

- dependency is et into the fields of the class directly
- spting uses reflection, it oterates over the fields and resolves the dependencies.
 - cant make immutable
 - put autowired on field
 - problem in tetsing cant do mocktesting
 - chances of NPE
 - give ex here
 
### Setter Injection

-set using setter
have to annoate the setter function withh autowired@

advantage

- dependency can be created anytime ater the job creation as object can be marked as final
- ease of tsting, as we can mock object in tetsing easily
disadvantage

- cannot make field final

### constructor

dependency get resolved at the initailix=zation of the object itself
fail fast
testing is easy

problem

## circular depemdecy

how to prevent-

1. using @Lazy
2. using @PostConstruct
    
##Unsatisfied depemdecy

1.@Primary
2. @Qualifier
