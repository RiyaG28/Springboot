# AOP 

- It helps to intercept the method invocation. And we can perform some task before and after the method.
- AOP allows us to focus on business logic by handling boilerplate, repetetive code like logging,etc.
- aspect is a module contains boilerplate code
- It helps in reusabilty, maintaibility of the code.
- Used during
	- logging
	- transaction mangement
	- security,etc.

1. Have to add dependency in pom,xml for using aop

when we put * -> atleast 1 matching requires

3. wildcard(..) -> matches 0 or more

 Here‚Äôs a table summarizing the various **Pointcuts** in Spring AOP and their uses:  

| **Pointcut**  | **Description** | **Example Usage** |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| `execution`  | Matches method execution based on method signature. | `execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))` (matches all methods in the service package) |
| `within`     | Matches methods within a specific class or package. | `within(com.example.service.*)` (matches all methods inside the `service` package) |
| `@within`    | Matches methods in classes annotated with a specific annotation. | `@within(org.springframework.stereotype.Service)` (matches all methods inside classes annotated with `@Service`) |
| `args`       | Matches methods based on their argument types. | `args(String, int)` (matches methods with parameters `String` and `int`) |
| `@args`      | Matches methods whose arguments are annotated with a specific annotation. | `@args(com.example.annotations.Secure)` (matches methods where at least one argument is annotated with `@Secure`) |
| `target`     | Matches methods where the target object is of a specific type. | `target(com.example.service.OrderService)` (matches methods in `OrderService` or its subclasses) |
| `@target`    | Matches methods of objects annotated with a specific annotation. | `@target(org.springframework.stereotype.Service)` (matches methods in objects annotated with `@Service`) |
| `this`       | Matches methods where the calling object is of a specific type (used for proxies). | `this(com.example.service.OrderService)` (matches methods called on a Spring proxy implementing `OrderService`) |
| `@annotation` | Matches methods annotated with a specific annotation. | `@annotation(com.example.annotations.Loggable)` (matches methods annotated with `@Loggable`) |
| `bean`       | Matches methods of specific Spring beans by name. | `bean(orderService)` (matches methods in the Spring bean named `orderService`) |
| `combine`    | Combines multiple pointcuts using logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`). | `execution(* com.example.*.*(..)) && @annotation(com.example.annotations.Loggable)` (matches loggable methods in `com.example`) |

In Spring AOP, `within` and `target` are **pointcut designators** used to define join points (places in the code where advice can be applied). Here's a clear distinction between the two:

---

### üîπ `within` ‚Äì Matches **declaring types** (class)

* **What it does:** Limits the join points to **methods declared within a certain type (class or package)**, regardless of what the actual object is.
* **Think:** *"Is the method declared inside this class?"*

```java
@Pointcut("within(com.example.service.MyService)")
public void withinExample() {}
```

‚úÖ Matches any method **declared in `MyService`**, even if it's called on a proxy of a subclass.

---

### üîπ `target` ‚Äì Matches **actual runtime object**

* **What it does:** Applies advice if the **target object at runtime** is of a given type (interface or class).
* **Think:** *"Is the actual object being called of this type?"*

```java
@Pointcut("target(com.example.service.MyService)")
public void targetExample() {}
```

‚úÖ Matches method calls **if the runtime object is of type `MyService`** (or a subclass), **even if the method is declared in a superclass or interface**.

---

### üîÅ Key Differences Table

| Feature        | `within`                               | `target`                               |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Matches on     | Class where the method is **declared** | Class of the **actual runtime object** |
| Static/dynamic | **Static** (compile-time)              | **Dynamic** (runtime)                  |
| Inheritance    | ‚ùå Does **not** match inherited methods | ‚úÖ Matches inherited methods            |
| Use case       | Restrict advice to a specific class    | Apply advice based on object type      |

---

### üß† Example:

```java
interface Service {
    void serve();
}

class MyService implements Service {
    public void serve() { }
}
```

* `within(Service)` ‚Üí ‚ùå will not match, because `serve()` is not declared in `Service`.
* `target(Service)` ‚Üí ‚úÖ will match, if the runtime object is `MyService`.
