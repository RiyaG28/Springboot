- In Spring, **bean scopes** determine the lifecycle of a bean within the IoC container, dictating when and how often beans are created and reused. 
- The default scope in Spring is **singleton**, but there are other scopes for various needs. 
- Additionally, each scope can be either **lazy** or **eagerly** initialized depending on how you configure it.

| **Scope**         | **Behavior**                                                        | **Use Case**                                  | **Example**                                  | **Default Initialization** |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Singleton**     | One instance per Spring container, reused for every request.        | Stateless, reusable components like services.  | Tax calculation service.                     | **Eager** (default)         |
| **Prototype**     | New instance created for each request.                              | Stateful beans, objects holding session data.  | Shopping cart object.                        | **Lazy**                    |
| **Request**       | One instance per HTTP request in web applications.                  | Request-specific data like auth tokens.        | User request context for HTTP request scope. | **Lazy**                    |
| **Session**       | One instance per HTTP session in web applications.                  | Session data maintained across user sessions.  | User session preferences and settings.       | **Lazy**                    |

### Details on Each Scope

1. **Singleton Scope** (Default)  
   - **Behavior:** Only one instance per Spring container, reused for every request.
   - **Initialization:** Eager by default, but can be configured to be lazy.
   - **Annotation Example:** `@Service public class TaxService { ... }`

2. **Prototype Scope**
   - **Behavior:** New instance created every time the bean is requested.
   - **Initialization:** Always lazy; a new instance is created only when requested.
   - **Annotation Example:** `@Component @Scope("prototype") public class ShoppingCart { ... }`

3. **Request Scope**
   - **Behavior:** One instance per HTTP request in Spring MVC applications.
   - **Initialization:** Lazy.
   - **Annotation Example:**  
     ```java
     @Component  
     @Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_REQUEST, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)  
     public class UserRequestContext { ... }
     ```

4. **Session Scope**
   - **Behavior:** One instance per HTTP session in Spring MVC applications.
   - **Initialization:** Lazy.
   - **Annotation Example:**  
     ```java
     @Component  
     @Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_SESSION, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)  
     public class UserSession { ... }
     ```

### Dynamically Initialized Beans Using `@Value` Annotation

1. **Qualifiers:** Initialize multiple beans and select dynamically.
2. **`@Configuration` Classes and @Bean Annotation:** Define beans without `@Component`.
3. **`@Value` Annotation:** Load values from `application.properties`, inline literals, or external property files.

### Why We Need `proxyMode`

1. **Scoped Beans in Singleton Beans**:
   - When you inject a `request`- or `session`-scoped bean into a singleton-scoped bean, Spring would normally inject the bean only once (as a singleton).
   - Without `proxyMode`, Spring would not be able to provide the correct instance per request or per session because the singleton bean would hold a single reference to the scoped bean.
   - With `proxyMode`, Spring creates a proxy that dynamically resolves the correct instance for each request or session, ensuring each injection is scope-compliant.

2. **Dynamic Resolution**:
   - The proxy allows Spring to resolve the actual instance of the bean only when itâ€™s needed at runtime. This makes it possible to get a new instance per HTTP request or session as required by the scope.

### Types of `proxyMode`

There are four main types of `proxyMode` in Spring:

| `proxyMode` Value                    | Description                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ScopedProxyMode.NO`                 | No proxy is created (default). Only works when the scope of the injected bean matches the context. |
| `ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS`       | Creates a CGLIB proxy, suitable for class-based (non-interface) beans.                      |
| `ScopedProxyMode.INTERFACES`         | Creates a JDK dynamic proxy, suitable for interface-based beans.                            |
| `ScopedProxyMode.DEFAULT`            | Uses the default proxy mode for the scope. Equivalent to `NO` unless a different default is set. |

**Example**

``
@Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_SESSION, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
``

**CGLIB (Code Generation Library)** enables Spring to create **class-based proxies** by generating subclasses that can override methods. This is essential for proxying beans without interfaces and is used for scoped beans or adding behaviors like transactions. CGLIB proxies can intercept and modify method calls, making it helpful for cross-cutting concerns.

For instance:

-   If a class `UserService` is proxied with CGLIB, Spring creates a subclass like `UserService$$EnhancerByCGLIB`.
-   This subclass can intercept method calls and apply additional logic, such as resolving the correct session-scoped instance.

**Limitations of CGLIB** include:

-   **Cannot proxy final classes/methods** (which cannot be subclassed)
-   Slight performance overhead due to dynamic subclassing
