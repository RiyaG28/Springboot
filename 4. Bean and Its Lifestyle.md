# Beans in Spring

### What is a Bean?
- A **Bean** is a Java object managed by the Spring container (also called the IoC container).
- The **IoC (Inversion of Control) container** holds all beans and manages their lifecycle and dependencies.
  - The IoC container, specifically `WebApplicationContext` in web applications, plays a crucial role here.

### How to Create a Bean
Beans can be created in Spring using two main annotations:

| Annotation      | Purpose                                                                                                           |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **@Component**  | Used to define a Spring-managed bean directly in the class. Automatically picked up by Spring's component scanning.|
| **@Bean**       | Used in a configuration class to define a bean with more specific configuration details. This tells Spring to use this method to create the bean.|

**Using @Component Annotation:**



The `@Component` annotation follows the "convention over configuration" approach. This means Spring Boot will try to auto-configure based on conventions, reducing the need for explicit configuration. Other annotations like `@Controller` and `@Service` work similarly by instructing Spring to create and manage the beans internally.

---

### How Does Spring Boot Find These Beans?
1. **@ComponentScan(basePackages="com.springboot.example")**:
   - Enables component scanning in the specified package. 
   - `@SpringBootApplication` already includes component scanning by default for the package it resides in.

2. **Explicit Bean Definitions**:
   - Beans can also be explicitly defined with `@Bean` in a configuration class.

---

### When Are Beans Created?
1. **Eager Initialization**:
   - By default, singleton-scoped beans are created eagerly at the start of the application.
   - This is typical for beans annotated with `@Component`.
  
2. **Lazy Initialization**:
   - Beans with prototype scope or marked with `@Lazy` are only created when needed.

### Lifecycle of a Bean
Beans in Spring follow a specific lifecycle, and Spring provides lifecycle annotations to control initialization and destruction.

**Bean Lifecycle Stages:**

1. **Instantiation**: The IoC container creates an instance of the bean.
2. **Dependency Injection**: Dependencies are injected into the bean using annotations like `@Autowired`.
3. **Initialization**: Custom initialization logic can be specified using `@PostConstruct`.
4. **Usage**: The bean is now available for use within the application.
5. **Destruction**: When the application shuts down, the `@PreDestroy` method allows for cleanup.


### Step 3: Dependency Injection in Spring



In **Step 3** of the bean lifecycle, dependency injection is handled. Using the `@Autowired` annotation, Spring first looks for a bean of the required type. If a matching bean is found, itâ€™s injected into the constructed bean using one of the following methods:

- **Constructor Injection**
- **Setter Injection**
- **Field Injection**

If no matching bean is found, Spring will create a new instance and inject it.

### Example Code for Bean Lifecycle

```java
import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class ExampleBean {
    
    @Autowired
    private Dependency dependency;

    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        System.out.println("ExampleBean is initialized.");
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void cleanup() {
        System.out.println("ExampleBean is about to be destroyed.");
    }
}

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    
    @Bean
    public Dependency dependency() {
        return new Dependency();
    }
}

public class Dependency {
    // Dependency class
}
```

In this example:
- `ExampleBean` is managed by Spring because of the `@Component` annotation.
- The `@PostConstruct` method `init()` runs after the bean has been fully initialized.
- The `@PreDestroy` method `cleanup()` is called before the bean is destroyed.

### Dependency Injection Types in Spring

1. **Constructor Injection**: Injects dependencies through the constructor.
2. **Setter Injection**: Injects dependencies through a setter method.
3. **Field Injection**: Directly injects dependencies into fields (commonly used with `@Autowired`).

Each injection type has its own advantages, which can be chosen based on design requirements.
