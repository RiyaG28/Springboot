   `@ConditionalOnProperty` - bean is created conditionally (can be created or not)

The `@ConditionalOnProperty` annotation in Spring enables **conditional bean creation** based on properties specified in the application's configuration files (like `application.properties`).

#### Syntax
``
@ConditionalOnProperty(prefix = "", value = "", havingValue = "", matchIfMissing = false)                                                               
``

In `application.properties`:
```
prefix.value = havingValue
```
```
@Autowired(required = false) - this is required when using @ConditionalOnProperty
```

`matchIfMissing` controls whether the condition matches when the property is not setâ€”`true` means it will match even if missing, `false` means it won't.


### Advantages

1. **Feature Toggling**: Enables activating or deactivating features through configuration.
2. **Reduces Bean Clutter**: Avoids loading unnecessary beans, keeping the application context cleaner.
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Saves memory by only loading beans when necessary.
4. **Optimized Startup Time**: Reduces startup time by only initializing required beans.

### Disadvantages

1. **Risk of Misconfiguration**: Incorrect property setup can lead to unexpected behavior.
2. **Increased Code Complexity**: Overuse can make code harder to follow and understand.
3. **Potential Confusion**: Multiple configurations with similar properties can be confusing.
4. **Management Challenges**: Requires careful management and documentation for consistency.
